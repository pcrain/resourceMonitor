Linux Resource Monitor, written in C -- version 0.2

Monitors the following resources
  - CPU Usage%
  - RAM Usage%
  - CPU Temperature
  - Power Draw (in watts)
  - Battery drain rate (in microJoules)
  - Batter Charge %
  - Download / upload speed of primary internet device
  - Read / write speed of primary hard drive
  - Fan speed

Usage
  - Run "make"
  - Run "./resmon"
    - Log file is saved to ~/.reslog.tsv
  - Run "./plotter.pg" to plot a graph of the last hour's resource usage (needs gnuplot)

Notes
  - All configuration for running and graphing is at the top of both source files (resourceMonitor.c and plotter.pg); you will likely need to configure them by pointing them towards the appropriate system resources for relevant hardware
